NAME
  acm -- acyclic complexity measure

SYNOPSIS
  acm [-a] [-c] [-t]

DESCRIPTION
  Static analysis automate code complexity measure for C style code (C, C++, C#, javascript, java).
  Measures standard input stream (stdin) to provide an absolute integer value. 
  Helps tracing isolated condition paths in detail.

  The following options are available:

    -a acyclic complexity, (linear-quadratic measure), regards nested code structures

    -c cyclomatic complexity, (linear measure), condition count

    -t trace isolated condition paths
